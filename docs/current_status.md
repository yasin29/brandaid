## What Is Done

### Infrastructure
- [x] Git repo initialized and connected to GitHub (`alviriseup/brand-AId`)
- [x] `.gitignore` updated (Node, venv, .env, dist)
- [x] `.env.example` committed with all required keys and comments
- [x] `CLAUDE.md` created with project rules and architecture summary
- [x] `docs/` folder created with persistent context files

### Backend
- [x] FastAPI app scaffolded (`backend/main.py`)
- [x] CORS configured for `http://localhost:5173`
- [x] Python 3.12 venv created at `backend/.venv/`
- [x] All dependencies installed (FastAPI, OpenAI 2.38.0, ChromaDB, pydantic-settings, aiofiles, etc.)
- [x] Pydantic schemas for all data shapes (`app/models/schemas.py`)
- [x] Config via `pydantic-settings` reading from `.env` (`app/core/config.py`)
- [x] `AsyncOpenAI` client initialized (`app/services/openai_client.py`)
- [x] All 6 AI pipeline stages implemented
- [x] Simulation orchestrator wiring all stages
- [x] `/api/simulate/` POST endpoint (multipart form with optional image upload)
- [x] `/health` GET endpoint
- [x] `max_tokens` → `max_completion_tokens` fix (was causing 400 errors)

### Frontend
- [x] Vite + React 18 + TypeScript scaffolded (Node 22)
- [x] TailwindCSS v4 + shadcn/ui installed and configured (dark theme)
- [x] shadcn components: button, card, input, label, progress, textarea, badge, select, separator
- [x] Path alias `@/` → `src/` configured
- [x] TypeScript types defined (`src/types/index.ts`)
- [x] API client (`src/lib/api.ts`)
- [x] Screen state machine in `App.tsx` (input → processing → results)
- [x] **InputPage V1**: shadcn components, platform Select, image preview, char counter, violet glow button
- [x] **ProcessingPage V1**: pulsing violet orb, animated stage list, live progress bar
- [x] **ResultsPage V1**: score display, persona cards with level badges, forecast tiles, risk list, before/after comparison

### Integration
- [x] End-to-end smoke test passed — full pipeline confirmed working
- [x] CORS confirmed working across ports (frontend → backend)

## Completed This Session (2026-05-25)

- [x] **Backend**: Added `DimensionScores` model (numeric 0–10 per dimension) to `CampaignAnalysis` schema
- [x] **Backend**: Updated `campaign_analyzer.py` prompt to return sub-scores alongside text
- [x] **Frontend**: Installed Chart.js + updated TypeScript types for `DimensionScores`
- [x] **ResultsPage V2**: Chart.js radar, count-up score animation, curtain reveal, "What's Working / Watch out" split, ranked rec cards, SVG sparklines, dramatic before/after side-by-side
- [x] **InputPage V2**: Visual platform tiles (7 platforms, color-coded), budget slider + presets, animated drag-and-drop zone
- [x] **Full UI redesign** — adopted team mock-up design system: light/dark hybrid, indigo (#4338CA) + emerald (#059669)
  - App.tsx: removed dark wrapper, added `campaignSummary` (objective + platform) threaded to ResultsPage
  - InputPage: light (#FAFAFE) background, white card form, native HTML inputs, indigo focus rings + channel tiles, large `$X,XXX` budget display
  - ProcessingPage: indigo orb, pipeline step list matching team's loading overlay
  - ResultsPage: dark hero with 4 metric cards + confidence breakdown bars; light 2-col body; emerald radar; sticky bottom action bar ("Rerun" + "Get Launch Plan")

### QA Reviewer Agent (2026-05-25)
- [x] **`QAReview` + `QAFlag` schemas** — added to `schemas.py` and frontend `types/index.ts`
- [x] **`qa_reviewer.py`** — Stage 7 of the pipeline; independent LLM pass reviewing full simulation output against 6 concrete criteria: forecast-persona consistency, risk specificity, recommendation-weakness alignment, persona differentiation, optimized copy quality, narrative coherence
- [x] **`simulation_orchestrator.py`** — wired as Stage 7 after re-simulation completes
- [x] **`ResultsPage.tsx`** — `QAReviewPanel` component: verdict badge (Pass/Partial Pass/Needs Improvement), confidence score + bar, reviewer notes, expandable flags list with severity tags; renders between hero and body

### ML Forecast Layer (2026-05-25)
- [x] **Kaggle dataset** — `Global Ads Performance (Google, Meta, TikTok)` — 1,800 rows, CTR + ROAS + spend
- [x] **`scripts/train_forecast_model.py`** — EDA-informed training: platform (84% importance) + budget_tier (12%) + campaign_type; R²=0.49, MAE=0.97%
- [x] **`data/models/`** — `ctr_model.joblib`, `encoders.joblib`, `dist_stats.json` (per-platform Q25/Q50/Q75 bands for ROAS)
- [x] **`ml_forecast_service.py`** — lazy-loads model, maps app platform/objective/budget → dataset categories, applies campaign_score to percentile band selection
- [x] **`forecast_engine.py`** — ML numbers injected into prompt as hard constraints; LLM narrates around ML-computed CTR and ROAS ranges
- [x] **`ForecastMetrics` schema** — added optional `roas_range` field

### RAG Integration (2026-05-25)
- [x] **Knowledge base** — 5 documents seeded in `backend/data/knowledge_base/`:
  - `platform_ctr_benchmarks.txt` — CTR by platform (Google, Meta, Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok, YouTube, Twitter)
  - `roas_conversion_benchmarks.txt` — ROAS by industry/platform, conversion rates, CPA, budget efficiency
  - `audience_psychology.txt` — Gen Z/Millennial/GenX/Boomer profiles, emotional triggers, trust signals
  - `platform_best_practices.txt` — Creative and targeting best practices per platform
  - `campaign_creative_guidelines.txt` — Copy effectiveness, visual signals, emotional tone, trust integration
- [x] **`rag_service.py`** — ChromaDB PersistentClient, auto-indexes on startup, cosine similarity retrieval, 500-word overlapping chunks, skips already-indexed docs
- [x] **FastAPI lifespan** — `initialize_rag()` called on server startup via `@asynccontextmanager lifespan`
- [x] **`forecast_engine.py`** — RAG retrieves CTR/ROAS benchmarks and injects into forecast prompt
- [x] **`recommendation_engine.py`** — RAG retrieves platform best practices and injects into recommendation prompt

## Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **ROAS-flip demo moment** — dramatic before/after with real numbers (ML + QA layers done)
2. **Prompt caching / token optimization** — reduce cost and latency
3. **Deployment** — configure for demo day
